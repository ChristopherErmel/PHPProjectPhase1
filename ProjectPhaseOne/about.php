               <h3>Review of Project Phase 1 by Christopher Ermel(200250446):</h3>
               <p>Throughout the development of this site I had encountered many challenges. I had issues styling my website, and using CSS. I had some issues with html and the interaction with concatenation as while as some variables (minor issues). The biggest issue I had when developing this site was retrieving the ID after the initial form submission. I was using old or ineffective methods and found a very simple and easy fix for retrieving the ID. I wanted to do this as an easy way for users to gain a personalized ID to their specific record. I was also unable to include some details and options on the site, due to knowledge and time constraints. I would like to have understood how to include a “Character count down limit” in the “Skills” form section, as well as developed better looking forms. The main site feature I would like to have had included was a log in portal for the users. I feel I have gained a great amount of knowledge in HTML, CSS and PHP throughout the completion of this project. I look forward to continuing the development of this site.</p>
               <h4>My next steps are as follows:</h4>
               <p>-Fix issue with character countdown limit on form</p>
               <p>-Style the form data in a better looking way</p>
               <p>-Develop a login portal for users of the site</p>
